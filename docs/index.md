## Key features

* Modelling declarations
		Change over time
* Flexibility
* Open codelists

## Outstanding issues

* Republishing & publisher metadata
* Change over time. Adding, updating or ending an interest is done as part of the declaration, by the declarer. Retraction is an action of the publisher. Relates to the above.
* Packaging
