Standardising Interest Declarations
===================================


## Background

(todo - brief overview of project, plus links, and how the idea of standardising declarations of interest related to the work.)

## Status of the draft data format

We present here an idea for standardising information declared by people about their interests. It is an idea - no more. And we hope that it might inform further work in this domain.

It is documented in a spreadsheet for convenience. Ultimtaely it could be rendered in JSON schema.

## Key features

* Modelling declarations
		Change over time
* Flexibility
    data profiles
* Open codelists

## Outstanding issues

* Republishing & publisher metadata
* Change over time. Adding, updating or ending an interest is done as part of the declaration, by the declarer. Retraction is an action of the publisher. Relates to the above.
* Packaging
